# treyweys-antibot-thread
My Personal Thread, where I post info and discuss about various antibot systems. It is time to help out all those washed clown devs. I don't want to name anyone, but those who I mean, know it :) 

This is my personal thread where I will share several methods or also scripts to bypass various Anti-Bot systems, so that you can easily scrape sites that are protected by complex scripts, or at least they seem something complicated and for the untrained eye un-understandable. Additionally I might also upload pre-made scripts beside the bypass-theory, so that you can take them and implement them in your scraper, bot, monitor or whatever. We will use Python mostly.

DISCLAIMER: I don't want to be shit on again, like when I posted the Akamai _abck Generator that was removed after literally an hour (Y'all some Clowns) . It is for EDUCATIONAL purpose only. If I find out you use one of my things in your scripts 1:1 (I will find out, don't worry) and try monetizing it (selling) I will opensource your shit!
